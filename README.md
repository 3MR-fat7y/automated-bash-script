# automated-bash-script-Ubuntu
The script automates the setup of a Ubuntu-based system by updating it, installing or updating tools:
1- AWS CLI
2- Terraform
3- Git
4- Docker
5- ansible
It prompts the user to choose whether to install or update each tool. Afterward, it displays a report of the installed versions and installs additional commonly used commands like `wget`, `curl`, `jq`, and `unzip`. This ensures a consistent and up-to-date development environment for tasks related to infrastructure management and development.
